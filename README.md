This repository acts a reference for those who wish to see simple examples of how to containerize (in this case, with 
docker) various languages. Since applications hosted in containers have been growing in popularity, I've found myself
reimplementing the same flavor of Dockerfile. Specifically the ability to serve static client files (HTML, Javascript).
Although this type of container does not make sense in a production environment, I've found it useful for development
environments
